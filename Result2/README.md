These files are results of the directory **Environment2**

# Description
The directory name is the method of Deep Reinforcement Learning in **Environment1**.

And each directory has the result directory of each learning rate."
For example, "R_MADQN(Ours)/SN5" has the directory, "1_0_e_4_timeslot_third". This name means that learning rate is 1.0e-4 and the third training.This name means that learning rate is 1.0e-4 and the second training.
And "SN5" shows the numbers of Ground Nodes in the training is 5.

The directory "1_0_e_4_timeslot_third" has some files.
